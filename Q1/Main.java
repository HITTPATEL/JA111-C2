//Q1) Explain the difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship with the help of an
//example and explain about access modifiers and their accessibility?

//Answer:
// HAS-A relationship:
//                    When we made two classes and put one class as a instance variable in another class,
// this is called HAS-a relationship.
//Example:
//       Let say A is class and B is another class.
// In class B we writes a variable A a;that is called HAS-a relationship.


//IS-A relationship :
//                  When we inherit a parent class to child class , then we can say that  Child IS-A 
//relationship and this is called IS-A relationship.
//Example :
//      Let say Animal is parent class and Dog is child class.
//Then we can say that DOG IS-A relationship


//Access Modifier :
//                Access modifier are used in java to know the accessibility of variable, method,and classes.
//There are four types of access modifier in java
//1. Public access modifier:
//                           We can access public access modifier from everywhere.

//2.Private access modifier:
//                           We can access private access modifier inside the class only.

//3.Default access modifier :
//                            We can access default access modifier inside the package only, they acts as
//  private for outside package.

//4. Protected access modifier:
//                              We can access default access modifier inside the package directly and for 
//accessing outside the package , we have to access with the help of inheritence.
//
